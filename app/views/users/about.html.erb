      Hello! Thanks for stopping by my site! My name is Grace Chow, and this site is a collection of my favorite works. I hope you enjoy them!
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Bar,_California">Diamond Bar, California</a>, with my parents and my one and only older sister, Priscilla. After moving to Berkeley for college, Iâ€™ve fallen in love with the Bay Area, especially San Francisco. I suppose it is the culture, the food, the landscape, and the people that made me stay after I graduated in May 2009. I am currently attending <a href="http://fidm.edu/">FIDM (Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising)</a> in downtown San Francisco, studying Fashion Design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently looking for a creative internship in the fashion industry that will exercise my art skills (<%= link_to "my resume", resume_path %>). I am passionate about both fashion and art, and I would love to get more experience working as an assistant fashion designer. Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or feedback you have for my site! Thank you!
